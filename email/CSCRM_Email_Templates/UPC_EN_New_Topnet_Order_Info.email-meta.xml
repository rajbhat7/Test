{!Salutation} {!CustomerName}

To be able to use the UPC Business service you have ordered, you need an intact broadband connection from UPC or one of our partner networks.

Should a socket already be available at the intended location, it needs to be inspected in advance and if necessary adapted to the latest technological standards.
In the event that there is no socket yet, one will be installed.
Our partner company will contact you in the next few days to arrange an appointment.

Please note that this appointment does not include the installation of UPC Business services.
As soon as the connection has been verified and checked, you will be contacted by our specialised partner regarding installation.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.

Yours sincerely
UPC Business
